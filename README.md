I did the exact same project with SFML and it was a lot faster to do it in Go, i should fix the FPS limit, Also do a chat system, but it was just to try Golang in a different way, also i wanted to implement go-tiled, since you can create quick maps to test, but the project only took me 1hour and i didn't want to add more things for now, maybe in the future i'll like it to a database and other things, who knows ?
